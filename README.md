This repository contains the code for BeatTheQueue, a web-based service designed to help you beat the queues at theme parks. 
The service allows users to select a theme park, preferred rides, and maximum wait time.
It then provides real-time alerts based on queue times for the selected rides.

## How to Use

1. Open the `theme_park_trip_planner_complete_with_api_calls.html` file in a web browser.
2. Select your preferences and click the "Generate Alerts" button.
3. Receive real-time alerts based on your selected preferences and real-time queue data.
